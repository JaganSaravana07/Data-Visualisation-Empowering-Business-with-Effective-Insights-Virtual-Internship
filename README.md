## There are 4 modules in this virtual experience programme
♦ Framing the Business Scenario

♦ Choosing the Right Visuals

♦ Creating Effective Visuals

♦ Communicating Insights and Analysis

## Task 1 - Framing the Business Scenario

### Develop the ability to predict the queries that the executives in your company will have
#### Background info and context

An online retail store has hired you as a consultant to review their data and provide insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO of the business. The business has been performing well and the management wants to analyse what the major contributing factors are to the revenue so they can strategically plan for next year.

The KPIs are of importance to the leadership from both an operations and a marketing standpoint. In order to maintain a laser-like focus on what is effective, management also wants to grow the company and is open to advice in areas that are doing well. Additionally, they would like to see various metrics according on the demographic data that is there in the data.

You have been asked to produce pertinent insights and analytics that will help assess the existing business performance and recommend measures that will allow them to decide whether to expand, and they have set a meeting with the CEO and CMO for next month.

Recall that you may examine the data more skilfully and provide greater insights if you approach it from the viewpoint of business executives.

#### Specifics for the assignment

You should prepare some questions in advance of your meeting that you believe the CEO and CMO will find pertinent and significant. As you work on your presentation, this preparation will serve as a guide.

All you have to do for this homework is write the questions down. Be sure to consider both qualitative and quantitative ideas.

In the materials below, you'll find a dataset to start your investigation with. Examine this data, noting what has been provided, any insights you can draw, and what is pertinent to the CMO and CEO, respectively.

Formulate a series of four enquiries that you believe every executive in the business world will have and will seek clarification on. Though the CEO and CMO have distinct perspectives on company decisions, make sure your queries are different.

A total of eight questions—four for the CEO and four for the CMO—were asked.

## Task 2 - Choosing the Right Visuals

Discover which images work best in a specific situation.

#### Background information and context

The CEO and CMO have asked you to submit visualisations of the metrics they want to evaluate for the online retail company. After gathering the necessary information, you will give them the kind of graphic that best fits the situation. Senior management is interested in learning about the company's capabilities and how the firm is doing. Their attention is also directed on recognising prospects that could result in expansion and increased earnings in the future.

The CEO will send you frequent requests for visuals, and it will be your responsibility to create the most straightforward visual explanation of the facts and insights. Your intended message should be sufficiently conveyed by the image. This practice is very important to senior management since misrepresentation might result in the wrong message being received or a bad choice being made by management. It would be necessary, therefore, to ensure that each type of data is represented by appropriate visuals.

#### Specifics for the assignment

It is necessary for you to thoroughly read the questions in this work and comprehend the business requirement. After you have a clear understanding of the requirements from the CEO's and CMO's points of view, you must create the ideal image that captures what the senior managers are seeking in each scenario. Recall that there are various ways to exhibit data in charts, but you must choose the one that will most effectively convey the information being given.

The resources area contains materials that will help you choose images depending on the various conditions. These tools will assist you in selecting the appropriate visual for the specific business scenario and in selecting the best chart or graph to use with your data. You will be required to respond to each question by providing a response based on the distinct situation that each question will contain.

Answer the multiple-choice questions to finish this assignment. Click 'Click here to start the task' in section 5 below to begin the quiz. Note that this exercise consists of five multiple-choice questions to answer. As each question loads, kindly be patient.

### Task 3 - Creating Effective Visuals

Utilise your skills to produce illustrations based on business scenarios.

#### Background information and context

In order to finalise the criteria, the CEO and CMO just met. They would like you to send them some analysis and visualisations that would help address their enquiries. The executives are eager to see and comprehend how they might use the information to inform decisions that have greater value. In order for them to develop the expansion strategy, you would need to offer insights. The executives seek to gain a clear understanding of the income generation process and the key elements influencing the online store by analysing the trends and the breakdown by several categories.

The executives' specifications and preferred method of data viewing will be given to you. You would need to confirm that the data you are using is high-quality and free of errors that could negatively affect your analysis after the requirement gathering phase. Using Tableau or Power BI, the graphics would be created after the data has been cleaned. Whichever tool you select for the graphics, the outcome ought to be the same. The executives will be able to make more informed decisions and implement their expansion plan with the support of these outcomes.

#### Specifics for the assignment

You have been tasked with creating the visuals for four of the questions that the CEO and CMO have asked. The data is available in the files below, and you can use Tableau or Power BI to generate the visualisations. To do this work, you can obtain the free trials of Power BI and Tableau. Here is a link to a resource that will walk you through downloading these free trials.

#### Data cleaning

Make sure the data has been cleaned correctly before starting the analysis. It has been observed that certain returns to the store are included in the data in negative quantities, and there are incorrectly entered unit pricing. You will need to perform the following steps to clean this data.

• Create a check that the quantity should not be below 1 unit

• Create a check that the Unit price should not be below $0

Note that you will need to employ conditional formulae where the logic says that the tool should exclude the data from analysis if the conditions are met in order to apply the checks that have been discussed previously. To eliminate the inaccurate data, you can also employ data transformation techniques. The resources section offers details on both of these approaches. The data will be ready for use in additional analysis after this is completed. Note that prior to attempting any questions, this data needs to be cleaned up.

Make sure that every image is in its own tab, with the tab name indicating the question number. Save the files and upload them here after the graphics are finished. For Tableau users, you would need to upload in .twbx format whereas Power BI files need to be saved in .pbix format. Instructions on how to save in these formats are provided in the resources section.

Should you get stuck, please reference the Visuals Hints document in the resources.

#### Question 1

The CEO of the retail store is interested to view the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011 only. He would like to view granular data by looking into revenue for each month. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur. This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the next year.

#### Question 2

The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue. Additionally, the CMO is also interested in viewing the quantity sold along with the revenue generated. The CMO does not want to have the United Kingdom in this visual.

#### Question 3

The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. He is interested in a visual that shows the greatest revenue generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue generating customers. The CMO wants to target the higher revenue generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products.

#### Question 4

The CEO is looking to gain insights on the demand for their products. He wants to look at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products. Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions that have high demand, he will initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more business from these regions. He wants to view the entire data on a single view without the need to scroll or hover over the data points to identify the demand. There is no need to show data for the United Kingdom as the CEO is more interested in viewing the countries that have expansion opportunities.

## Task 4 - Communicating Insights and Analysis

Explain how your findings apply to each scenario and effectively communicate them.

#### Background knowledge and context

Time to provide the CEO and CMO a report on your findings. Your methodology and approach to data cleansing and visualisation are of interest to them. Clearly and concisely articulating your ideas and thought process is crucial. A clear presentation of the analysis of each of the four questions from the prior challenge is also necessary. A thorough understanding of the facts and the conclusions drawn from your study is essential.

These executives prioritise growth and are interested in figuring out where their company offers the best chances for financial gain.

Specifics for the assignment

Based on the four questions posed by the CEO and CMO and the graphics you produced for the previous tasks, write a script and record a video to communicate your results.

To develop your presentation, you can refer to your work or the sample response from the prior challenge.

To let your executives know that you've done your research and are offering error-free analysis, you should discuss every stage of your process in your script, including the initial data load and cleanup procedures. There is a wealth of information available from data analysis, but keep in mind that your leaders care about the information that matters most to them.

The duration of your video should be roughly five minutes. You can upload a video from your smartphone or record one in the browser below.

Recall that you are presenting to the CEO and CMO, so this is not just a read-out of your images. You must explain each scenario and how it pertains to their questions.
